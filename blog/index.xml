      <description>Hello there,
My name is Amirreza Ghaderi. Iâ€™m a software developer.
As the title would suggest, it&amp;rsquo;s my first post on this blog. I started this blog simply because i like to write. it helps me to keep my mind clear; I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who always keeps a pen and paper around. Its not easy for me to understand or think about something, unless i write it down. It also feels good to share your knowledge with others!</description>
