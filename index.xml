      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Amirreza Ghaderi. I’m a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title would suggest, it&amp;rsquo;s my first post on this blog.
I started this blog simply because i like to write. it helps me to keep my mind clear; I&amp;rsquo;m one of those people who always keeps a pen and paper around. Its not easy for me to understand or think about something, unless i write it down. It also feels good to share your knowledge with others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blogged for many years but this is my first attempt to writing a blog in English—which is not my first language. This blog will be mostly about software development or any other subject that captures my interest along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p.s. I will probably going to use this post as my &amp;ldquo;About&amp;rdquo; page. :)&lt;/p&gt;
